                To be honest, I could not find anyone else on YouTube who does not copy and paste or watch a second
                monitor while presenting themselves as a super developer. Sahand is truly exceptional; he has taught me
                what development looks like. His videos are recorded naturally, as he looks at Figma and writes code
                like a real developer. Sahand is undeniably one of the best YouTubers I have ever seen.
